Upon returning to Australia, Luke and his family moved to Melbourne where he finished High School and attempted 2 different degrees before deciding that paid work was more for him at that stage. Luke has a keen and enthusiastic interest in computing technology, and has always had a penchant for exploring how computer systems work. With the help of qualified and smarter friends, Luke learnt how to use the Linux command line and how to independently create and run websites – an achievement that doesn’t sound like much, but was a personal goal over 10 years in the making! Luke is an enthusiastic Amateur Radio operator and an active Scout Leader. When he's not participating as a Leader of Youth in Scouting, or planning an exciting STEM activity for the kids, he can be found tinkering with electronics, exploring the great outdoors on a long drive, catching up with mates over a cuppa, or hanging out with family and friends.</p>

                                                    <p class="text-muted">As the profile fits, Luke is considerate of the best possible outcomes from a given situation, not just for the task at hand but for the people involved. Inspired and eager, Luke enjoys working in an energetic environment where each participant is included and involved in making something together from the sum of their capabilities. Luke is best paired with team members who have the ability to balance the imagery and idealistic concepts that Luke can be enthusiastic about, and can use support of others who are more tactical, detailed, or methodical in their deliberations to achieve results.</p>

As both Audible and Visual cues are instructive, a combination of both allows him to best digest and consider information presented to him, usually in tandem.

They work as a facilitator of business functions by scoping and developing technical solutions for the business.</p>
                                                <p class="text-muted">They must consider the challenge of balancing current infrastructure dependencies that the business relies on, and ensure backwards compatibility and growth opportunities are present when compiling solutions for the future.</p>
                                                <p class="text-muted">Luke's appeal for the role is the challenge of managing stakeholders across  different parts of the business to provide the right solution to challenging problems. A Solutions Architect should be able to work with all types of people, and be open to new ideas, new ways of thinking from diverse business areas to get the best results for a truly dynamic system.</p>

While studying, Luke works with the IT support team of his employer, and is developing skills in responding to the businesses needs as changes are required. In coming years, Luke is hoping to branch into a more technical role to gain experience as a system engineer, facilitating the growth and development of client solutions under skilled leadership in the industry.</p>
                                                <p class="large text-muted">Luke may also complete certifications, such as a Cisco networking certification, to gain knowledge and a new skillset to meet the needs of future prospects.

Also being a tactile learner means that it’s easier for me to learn by doing and by being there in the moment. If there’s one thing that I can completely agree with the result is that I need to be frequently active making it hard to sit still which gives my team an opportunity to use that energy and convert it into actions.</p>

One of the things that a software developer does is analyse the users’ needs and then design, test and develop a software to meet those needs. If anyone wants to become a software developer, they would need at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science, software engineering or a related field.</p>

As a developer I am also going to need to work with other developers so learning Git is also one of my goals as this software will allow me collaborate and work with other programmers and most importantly track the changes made to the code. As most of us know there are always bugs when there’s a new software released and I have read that Jira is a pretty handy tool for bug tracking and issue tracking so that one is on my list as well. As I have already learned the basics of Java I also want to get started with Jenkins which is the bridge that will help me deliver the software from the development stage to the production stage.</p>

I am currently attempting to learn mandarin as I have heard it is a great way to improve memory and sharpen the mind, not to mention it would definitely be a skill that would make me more employable and allow me to travel a bit in the future for my ideal job. I am a huge American Football fan and I follow the "Las Vegas Raiders" in the NFL and the "Ohio State Buckeyes" in College Football.

This is all quite accurate to me as I do have a hard time learning and committing things to memory when looking at diagrams and trying to do things myself. I find I have a much easier time of learning things when I am having it explained to me. I will often read something repeatedly and I need to read it aloud to myself to properly understand it. Understanding this, I am trying to participate in discussions more within class and groups.</p>

I am also very spontaneous and disorganised with plans and hate to have a set schedule.</p>
